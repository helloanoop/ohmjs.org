# Ohm v17.0

v17.0.0 is primarily a cleanup release in preparation for some new features that will be coming soon in minor releases. It contains a few breaking changes (as described below), but they are unlikely to affect the majority of Ohm users.

This version also has experimental support for [indentation-sensitive grammars](#new-features).

## Upgrading

### `any` now consumes a full code point

In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of 16-bit code units. Some Unicode characters, such as emoji, are encoded as pairs of 16-bit values. For example, the string 'ðŸ˜†' has length 2, but contains a single Unicode code point. Previously, `any` matched a single 16-bit code unit â€” even if that unit was part of a surrogate pair. In v17, `any` now matches a full Unicode character.

Old behaviour:

```js
const g = ohm.grammar('OneChar { start = any }');
g.match('ðŸ˜†').succeeded(); // false
```

New behaviour (Ohm v17+):

```js
const g = ohm.grammar('OneChar { start = any }');
g.match('ðŸ˜†').succeeded(); // true
```

### Namespace helpers removed

The top-level `namespace` and `extendNamespace` functions have been removed. They were never required â€” it was always possible to use a plain old object in any API that asked for a namespace.

For example, take the following code (which no longer works in v17+):

```js
const ns = ohm.createNamespace();
ns.G = ohm.grammar('G {}');
ns.G2 = ohm.grammar('G2 <: G {}', ns);
```

In Ohm v17 _and_ in previous versions, the code could instead be written like this:

```js
const ns = {}; // <- Use a normal object literal
ns.G = ohm.grammar('G {}');
ns.G2 = ohm.grammar('G2 <: G {}', ns);
```

### Named exports only

When used as ES module, the `ohm-js` and `ohm-js/extras` modules now have _only_ named exports, and no default export. This fixes some issues with the use of Ohm bundles (`.ohm-bundle` files) when used with JS module bundlers like Webpack and Rollup (e.g., [#377][issue-377]).

As a result, the following code will no longer work (unless your bundler supports [synthetic default imports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports)):

```js
import ohm from 'ohm-js';
```

In Ohm v17, it should be written like this:

```js
import * as ohm from 'ohm-js';
```

See [#386](https://github.com/harc/ohm/issues/386) for more context on this change.

### `util` removed

The `util` object has been removed from Ohm's public API. The two methods that were relevant to grammar authors â€” `getLineAndColumn` and `getLineAndColumnMessage` â€” have been moved into the `extras` module.

Old code (no longer works):

```js
ohm.util.getLineAndColumnMessage(str, [startIdx, endIdx]);
```

New code (works in Ohm v17+):

```js
import {getLineAndColumnMessage} from 'ohm-js/extras';
// ...
getLineAndColumnMessage(str, [startIdx, endIdx]);
```

By the way, the `Interval` class also has a `getLineAndColumnMessage` method, which can be useful inside of semantic actions. For example, if you are using this method with the `sourceString` attribute, like this:

```js
getLineAndColumnMessage(aNode.sourceString, [startIdx, endIdx]);
```

...you can write it this way instead:

```js
aNode.source.getLineAndColumnMessage();
```

### `toAST` on built-in list rules

Ohm v17 changed the default behavior of `toAST` for the built-in list rules (`ListOf` and friends). Both the syntactic (`ListOf`, ...) and lexical versions (`listOf`, ...) are now represented as arrays, with the separators _discarded_. Previously, the syntactic versions were represented by arrays, but with separators _included_, and the lexical versions were represented as strings (just like other lexical rules).

See [#394](https://github.com/harc/ohm/issues/394) for the reasoning behind this change.

## New features

- **(EXPERIMENTAL)**: This release includes experimental support for indentation-sensitive grammars (e.g., Python, Elm, YAML). See the guide to [Parsing indentation sensitive languages](../indentation-sensitive.md).

## Other changes

- The deprecated `grammarFromScriptElement` and `grammarsFromScriptElements` functions have been entirely removed.
- The `primitiveValue` property of nodes, which was deprecated in Ohm v16, has now been completely removed â€” use `Node.sourceString` instead.
