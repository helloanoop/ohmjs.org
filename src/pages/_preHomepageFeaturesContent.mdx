Ohm is a parsing toolkit consisting of a library and a domain-specific language. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.

The _Ohm language_ is based on [parsing expression grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. The _Ohm library_ provides a JavaScript interface for creating parsers, interpreters, and more from the grammars you write.
